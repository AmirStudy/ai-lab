# Quick-start Guide

Welcome to AI Lab!

AI Lab (`nvaitc/ai-lab`) is an all-in-one AI development container for rapid prototyping. What does that mean? It means that this container (as supporting software) has been painstakingly tailored to provide you with the best out of the box experience to use various Machine Learning and Deep Learning frameworks. These include the usual Python libraries (numpy, pandas), ML libraries (scikit-learn, [xgboost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) and [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/)), and Deep Learning frameworks ([TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)). Where possible, all libraries are GPU-accelerated and optimised for performance.

## Important System Requirements

Don't worry if you don't meet any of the system requirements. Head over to the detail setup guide to sort out any issues with your system setup.

1. Ubuntu 16.04, or Ubuntu 18.04
2. Latest stable NVIDIA drivers (currently 410)
3. NVIDIA container runtime (`nvidia-docker`)

If you meet the above requirements, you are good to go.

## Before we continue

If you've never encountered containers, Jupyter notebooks or any of the frameworks mentioned above, please feel free to head over to their website, or check out the articles below.

* What is a Docker container?
* What is Jupyter Notebook? (What is JupyterLab?)
* [Why data scientists love Jupyter](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1), and some [tips and tricks to make the best out of it](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/jupyter-notebook-cheat-sheet)!

This guide is meant to be a companion to the web GUI and is designed for beginners.
